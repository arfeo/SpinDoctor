## About

SpinDoctor is a *revolutionary* arcade-style game that will sharpen your skills and engage your mind. As you swing, flip, and bounce your white wand from dot to dot, SpinDoctor challenges you to navigate through a moving obstacle course of nasty rotating colour wands, spikes, acid droplets, moving doors, fuses, bombs, and much more. And you only need four keyboard keys to play!

The original game was created by Callisto Corporation in 1993.
